# Alien Invasion
Aliens are trying to invade the planet and the player must use their tank to shoot the aliens and clear the skies before they reach the planet.  Points are added when a player shoots an alien, and each type of alien is worth different points.  The game is over when the player runs out of lives or the aliens reach the surface.  

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

## Overview
Aliens are trying to invade the planet and you must use your tank to shoot the aliens and clear the skies before they reach the planet.  
# Rules
There can be 1 or 2 players.
A player has 3 lives.
If 2 players are selected, each will take alternating turns and each turn ends when a life is gone.  
Each player moves his tank in a horizontal position.  
The object of Alien Invasion is to shoot as many aliens and clear the board, accruing points.  Highest score wins. 
There are 4 types of aliens in 4 rows, with each row the same type of alien.  Each type of Alien has points associated with them, with the top row of Alien being worth the most points, and the bottom row worth the least points.
At start of game play, there are bunkers in a fixed position just above the tank to hide behind.  Shooting the bunkers, whether done by the player or the aliens, will cause the bunkers to disintegrate, eventually leaving the player and the surface exposed, and the aliens can then reach the planet’s surface.
The game is over when the player runs out of lives or the aliens reach the surface.  “Game Over” will display.

## Requirements for Final Project
•	The program may be any type of game or interactive simulation.
•	The program should use classes and instances.
•	The program should apply the four principles of programming with classes.
•	The program should use the libraries chosen in the course.
•	The program should be delivered through a version control system.
•	The program should be able to be run from the command line.
Strive to apply the principles of programming with classes so that your program is maintainable. Whatever you choose for your final project, it should be easy to change.
